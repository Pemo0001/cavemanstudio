        <h2 class="subpageh2">WHAT CAN YOU HELP ME WITH?</h2>
        <p>I can help you bring to life, that idea of a song you once had, but never got to creating. I enjoy creating sonic landscapes with organic sounding guitars, banjos, mellotron arrangements, and whatever instrument I can get my hands on.</p>
        <h2 class="subpageh2">WHAT CAN I HIRE YOU FOR?</h2>
        <ul><li>Producing</li><li>Mixing</li><li>Recording instruments on your tracks</li></ul>
        <h2 class="subpageh2">DO WE NEED TO BE TOGETHER?</h2>
        <p>I work both remotely and face-to-face, so there is no need for you to be in Copenhagen, for us to be able to work together.</p>
